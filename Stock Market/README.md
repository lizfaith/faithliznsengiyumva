## STOCK MARKET DASHBOARD
# Skills
Tableau, Pandas

# Actions
I got the data from Kagggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset).

I used Pandas to manipulate my data and created new columns like moving avarage and percentage change which were used for comparison in order to get csv files that will be used to create the dashboard.
