## STOCK MARKET DASHBOARD
# Skills
Tableau, Pandas
# Overview
In this portfolio, we will explore a stock market dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing historical daily prices for select tickers trading on NASDAQ. The dataset includes prices up to April 1, 2020, with additional data collection scripts available for more up-to-date information. Each CSV file in the dataset follows a common structure, including fields such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.

# Actions
I got the data from Kagggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset). I did not use all the data sets available but chose just six of the them. Ii used data from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Google, Nvidia, and Twitter. 

I used Pandas to manipulate my data and created new columns like moving avarage and percentage change which were used for comparison in order to get csv files that will be used to create the dashboard.
