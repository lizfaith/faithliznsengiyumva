# Overview
The objective of this portfolio is to provide Senior Leadership with recommendations on what food and beverage offers should be implemented in new store locations based on an analysis of store performance data.

# Background
 The company currently operates stores in six states and is looking to expand into additional states. Store types include Travel Center, EDO, and 5.5k, each catering to different customer demographics and traffic patterns.

# Tasks
 The analysis will involve examining the performance data of existing stores, considering factors such as inside sales, chicken sales, pizza sales, coffee sales, frozen yogurt sales, DoorDash orders, inside guest count, and store type. We create metrics to assess the average performance of each store type and offer. Additionally, we evaluate the stores individually, as not all of them are open at the same time, and group them by location to provide a comprehensive understanding of their performance.

# Actions
To provide comprehensive insights, we begin by collecting and organizing performance data from existing stores. Next, we conduct a thorough analysis to identify trends and patterns in store performance, considering various factors such as inside sales, chicken sales, pizza sales, coffee sales, frozen yogurt sales, DoorDash orders, and inside guest count. Additionally, we evaluate individual stores to assess their specific performance metrics. Grouping stores by location will allow us to gain insights into regional performance trends. Subsequently, we will create metrics to evaluate the average performance of each store type and offer. Based on our analysis, we will formulate recommendations on the food and beverage offers that should be implemented in new store locations. Finally, we present our findings and recommendations to Senior Leadership through an Excel document and PowerBI Dashboard, ensuring clarity and actionable insights for informed decision-making.
