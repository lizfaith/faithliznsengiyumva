# GLOBAL COVID-19 VACCINE TRACKER
## OVERVIEW
The global COVID-19 crisis has impacted millions worldwide, prompting the urgent need for vaccination as a primary defense.However, vaccine distribution has been inconsistent globally, with certain countries advancing rapidly while others struggle to keep pace. This project aims to offer comprehensive insights into the global vaccination effort, emphasizing daily assessments of its speed and scope.
## Task
In my role as a data analyst for this initiative, my task was to develop and deploy a dashboard enabling users to delve into crucial metrics concerning the global vaccination initiative. Collaborating closely with the project team, we pinpointed the most pertinent data sources and metrics for monitoring. Subsequently, I utilized Tableau, a widely acclaimed and robust data visualization tool, to craft an interactive dashboard facilitating real-time exploration of the data.
## Action
To construct the dashboard, I employed the Our World in Data COVID vaccination dataset(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), a regularly updated resource that draws from the latest official data provided by governments and health ministries globally. I structured the dashboard to encompass vital metrics, including the proportion of the population partially or fully vaccinated, daily administered vaccine doses, daily boosters administered, and the correlation between GDP and vaccination program effectiveness. Additionally, the dashboard features visually engaging map charts and offers filtering options by date, country, and continent. You can preview the dashboard below.
## Result
The vaccination dashboard has been an immense triumph, offering invaluable insights into the advancement of the worldwide vaccination initiative. It has been widely utilized by policymakers, researchers, and the public to monitor vaccination progress and pinpoint areas necessitating additional support. Some measurable achievements of the initiative encompass:

Enhanced transparency and accountability within the global vaccination endeavor.
Strengthened collaboration among nations and entities combatting the pandemic.
Expedited strides towards attaining herd immunity in numerous regions.

## Reflection
This endeavor underscored the significance of employing data visualization tools to convey intricate information clearly and succinctly. Additionally, it emphasized the critical role of collaboration and teamwork in attaining project objectives. Looking ahead, my focus would be on integrating more real-time data sources and enhancing the dashboard's user-friendliness to further refine its effectiveness.
